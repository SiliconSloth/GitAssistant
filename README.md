# Git Assistant

A simple natural language chat bot interface for [Metro](https://github.com/SiliconSloth/Metro), our simple Git wrapper.
It aims to make Git easier to use for new users, by reducing the need to remember specific command syntax for various tasks.

## Usage

Run Git Assistant with `python mass.py`. This will start an interactive natural language prompt.  Type `exit` to exit the prompt.
Alternatively, you can execute a single command by passing a natural language command in the program arguments,
e.g. `python mass.py Commit to the current branch.`
